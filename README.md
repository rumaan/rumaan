### Heya 👋

- 🔭 Currently building [Edumentors](https://edumentors.co.uk)
- 🤤 I have a thing for micro animations and those tiny UI details that people generally don't notice or care about :|
- 🤓 I occasionally write on [rumaan.dev](https://rumaan.dev)
- 🎧 I like listening to Synth/Retrowave
- 🌱 Proud parent of 13 indoor plants (mostly succulents)
- ⌨️ Recently, I've been into Mechanical Keyboards and Switches (trust me, the rabbit hole goes deep)

✨✨
